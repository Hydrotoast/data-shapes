				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is an RDF vocabulary for describing RDF graph structures.
        These graph structures are captured as "shapes", which are expected to correspond to nodes in RDF graphs.
				These shapes identify predicates and their associated cardinalities and datatypes.
        Additional constraints can be associated with shapes using SPARQL or other languages which complement SHACL.
        SHACL shapes can be used to communicate data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces.
			</p>
			<p>
				This document defines the semantics of SHACL and binds them to an RDF vocabulary.
				The accompanying <a href="../data-shapes-primer/no-class-templates.html">primer</a> provides an informal overview of SHACL, describing by example the behavior of components of the SHACL langauge.

      		<h2>Introduction</h2>
      		<p>
      			SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) provides structural constraints for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graphs</a>.
            SHACL constraints are grouped into conjunctions called "shapes", which may also be referenced by constraints in other shapes.
            These constraints restrict the predicates of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-triple">triples</a> connecting nodes in the graph.
            SHACL can restrict the number of these triples and the permitted object datatype or object terms, as well as require that the subject or object match some shape.
      		</p>
	  		
      		<p>
      			SHACL definitions are represented in RDF and can be serialized in multiple RDF formats.
      			The example snippets in this document use Turtle [[turtle]] and JSON-LD [[json-ld]] notation.
      			the reader should be familiar with basic RDF concepts [[rdf11-concepts]] such as triples and (for the advanced concepts of SHACL) with SPARQL [[sparql11-overview]].
      		</p>

	  			<h3>What are Shapes and Constraints (normative)</h3>
	  			<!--
	  				(HK) Eric, I have taken your prose from your primer but renamed "target node" to
	  				"current node". What do you think? To me it seems to make sense to call this the
	  				current node because the predicate (or any path) is evaluated starting from there,
	  				not ending there (as "target" would imply).
	  				
            (ericP) HK, makes sense; I picked "focus node" because, as you saw, it's hard to
            use definite articles ("the") on "current node". Being diligent about <code>focus
            node</code> allows us to do a global replace when someone in the WG proposes a
            better term.

	  				I have also generalized "property constraint" into "constraint", because there can
	  				be complex conditions that do not just check one property (e.g. width and height). 
	  			-->
        <p>
          A <code>shape</code> describes the triples coming into and out of the <code>focus node</code> in an RDF graph.
          A shape has <code>constraints</code> attached to it which describe the <code>focus node</code>'s triples.
					Some of these <code>constraints</code> can be about a specific property only, these are called <code>property constraints</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <code>property constraint</code> has a <code>predicate</code> which identifies the triple's predicate and may have a <code>minimum cardinality</code> and <code>maximum cardinality</code>, to indicate how many triples with that predicate are expected.
          The following attributes are used to constrain the object of each of triples with that predicate:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>node type</code>: identifies the RDF node type (IRI, RDF literal, or Blank Node).</li>
          <li><code>value type</code>: identifies the datatype of an RDF literal.</li>
          <li><code>allowed value</code>: enumerates specific expected values.</li>
          <li><code>value shape</code>: asserts that the object is described by another shape.</li>
        </ul>
	  		</section>
	  		
	  		<section>
	  			<h3>What can you do with Shapes (informative)</h3>
          <p>
            SHACL shapes act as a selection criteria for RDF graphs.
            One use of shapes is to define requirements form input data or an application or suite of applications.
            It can also be used to declare the structre of data in some graph or at some SPARQL endpoint.
            Another use is to drive form generation which prompts users to enter data to construct graphs.
            The semantics for shapes are described here in terms of "matching" some data against a shape with the expectation that this functionality is inherent to these uses.

        <p>
          A <code>constraint</code>'s <code>minimum cardinality</code> and <code>maximum cardinality</code> are identified by <span class="type">sh:</span><span class="constant">minCount</span> and <span class="type">sh:</span><span class="constant">maxCount</span> respectively.
          The RDF properties for constraining objects are:
