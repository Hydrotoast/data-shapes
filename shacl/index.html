				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is an RDF vocabulary for describing RDF graph structures.
				Some of these graph structures are captured as "shapes", which group together constraints about the same RDF nodes.
				Shapes provide a high-level vocabulary to identify predicates and their associated cardinalities, datatypes and other constraints.
				Additional constraints can be associated with shapes using SPARQL and similar executable languages.
				These executable languages can also be used to define new high-level vocabulary terms.
				SHACL shapes can be used to communicate data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces.
				This document defines the SHACL RDF vocabulary together with its underlying semantics.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is an RDF vocabulary to formulate structural constraints on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graphs</a>.
				The SHACL vocabulary includes high-level concepts to represent restrictions on predicates used in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-triple">triples</a>.
				These restrictions can be grouped into "<span class="term">shapes</span>".
				Shapes can be used to restrict the number of property values and the permitted value types as well as other conditions.
				Some users and implementors will be content with using the high-level shapes language only, which is called the <span class="term">SHACL Core Profile</span>
				and is described in sections 2 to 6 of this document.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more complex use cases, SHACL also includes facilities to express other restrictions in an executable language such as SPARQL and, possibly, other languages such as JavaScript.
				SHACL includes macro facilities that encapsulate reusable building blocks based on these executable languages into <span class="term">templates</span> and <span class="term">functions</span>.
				These advanced topics are covered from section 7 onwards. 
			</p>
			<p>
				SHACL definitions are represented in RDF and can be serialized in multiple RDF formats.
				The example snippets in this document use Turtle [[turtle]] and <span class="todo">(not written yet:)</span> JSON-LD [[json-ld]] notation.
				The reader should be familiar with basic RDF concepts [[rdf11-concepts]] such as triples and (for the advanced concepts of SHACL) with SPARQL [[sparql11-overview]].

				<h3>Overview and Terminology of Core Features</h3>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates the use of SHACL to define constraints on issues in a hypothetical bug tracking system.
					In the example scenario, the RDFS class <code>ex:Issue</code> is used to represent issues, and the class <code>schema:Person</code> represents users.
					Each <code>ex:Issue</code> must point to exactly one user via the property <code>ex:submittedBy</code> and may have one value for <code>ex:assignedTo</code>.
					Users that have submitted an issue must also have a <code>schema:email</code> address, so that they can be notified when the issue has been updated. 
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Definition of ex:Issue and ex:SubmitterShape">
ex:Issue
	a sh:ShapeClass ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:assignedTo ;
		rdfs:label "assigned to" ;
		rdfs:comment "The assignee of an issue must be a person." ;
		sh:maxCount 1 ;
		sh:valueClass schema:Person ;
	] ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:submittedBy ;
		rdfs:label "submitted by" ;
		rdfs:comment "The submitter of an issue must be a person who also has an email address." ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:maxCount 1 ;
		sh:valueClass schema:Person ;
		sh:valueShape ex:SubmitterShape ;
	] .

ex:SubmitterShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	rdfs:comment "A submitter must have at least one email address." ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate schema:email ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
	] .</pre>
				<p>
					The basic building blocks of SHACL are <span class="term">constraints</span>.
					Each <span class="term">constraint</span> defines a condition that can be validated against a graph.
					When constraints are validated, they can access a specific node in the graph, called the <span class="term">focus node</span>.
					A <a href="#shapes"><span class="term">shape</span></a> describes a group of <span class="term">constraints</span> with the same <span class="term">focus node</span>.
					Many of these constraints are about a certain property only, and these are called <a href="#property-constraints"><span class="term">property constraints</span></a>.
					<span class="term">Constraints</span> are evaluated against a given <span class="term">focus node</span>, which serves as starting point of property paths and other graph traversal algorithms.
					In the current draft, the IRIs of classes (such as <code>ex:Issue</code> above) may also be used as shapes.
					Such shape classes may be arranged in a <span class="term">specialization</span> hierarchy, allowing some shapes to further narrow down the constraints from other shapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the Issue example above, the shape <code>ex:Issue</code> includes two constraints.
					These constraints are here represented as blank nodes via <code>sh:property</code>.
					Each of these constraints specifies the restricted property via <code>sh:predicate</code>, and one or more constraint properties such as <code>sh:minCount</code> and <code>sh:valueClass</code>.
					The property <code>sh:valueShape</code> points to another <code>sh:Shape</code> that defines additional constraints that the values of
					the <code>ex:submittedBy</code> property must fulfill, in addition to being instances of <code>schema:Person</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the <a href="#operations"><span class="term">operations</span></a> that SHACL engines should support validates that a given RDF node matches a given shape.
					This operation can be invoked based on any control logic, i.e. applications can pick their own mapping between RDF nodes and their shapes.
					Another supported operation is to validate all nodes in a given graph.
					In order to support that operation, SHACL has the concept of <span class="term">scopes</span>.
					<span class="term">Scopes</span> are attached to shapes and produce a collection of nodes that shall be validated against the shape.
					SHACL provides several scoping mechanisms, including node selection based on <code>sh:nodeShape</code> and <code>rdf:type</code> triples,
					as well as a more general scoping framework that produces focus nodes based on an executable language such as SPARQL.
					The scope of a shape can be narrowed down via <span class="term">filter shapes</span> that define pre-conditions that all focus nodes need to fulfill before they are evaluated.
					The output of constraint validation is a set of <a href="#violations"><span class="term">constraint violations</span></a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following example code defines two instances of the class <code>ex:Issue</code>.
					When constraint validation is started, a SHACL engine may follow the <code>rdf:type</code> link of these instances to determine which shapes need to be used.
					(If <code>ex:Issue</code> were not a class but a <code>sh:Shape</code>, then the property <code>sh:nodeShape</code> would have been used instead).
					The first instance passes validation without producing any violations.
					The second instance produces an <code>sh:Error</code>, because its value for <code>ex:submittedBy</code> does not have an <code>schema:email</code>. 
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Sample Issue instances with resulting constraint violations">
ex:ValidExampleIssue
	a ex:Issue ;
	ex:assignedTo ex:UserWithoutEmail ;
	ex:submittedBy ex:UserWithEmail .
	
ex:InvalidExampleIssue
	a ex:Issue ;
	ex:submittedBy ex:UserWithoutEmail .

ex:UserWithoutEmail
	a schema:Person .
	
ex:UserWithEmail
	a schema:Person ;
	schema:email "someone@example.org" .</pre>
				<p>
					When this instance data is validated, a SHACL engine will produce the following constraint violations:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Constraint violations for the sample instances">
[
	a sh:Error ;
	sh:root ex:InvalidExampleIssue ;
	sh:subject ex:InvalidExampleIssue ;
	sh:predicate ex:submittedBy ;
	sh:object ex:UserWithoutEmail ;
	sh:message "Value does not have the shape ex:SubmitterShape." ;
]</pre>

				<h3>Overview and Terminology of Advanced Features</h3>
				<p>
					The following paragraphs give an overview of the advanced features of SHACL.
					Readers only interested in the Core Profile may skip this section.
				</p>
				<p>
					The validation of each <span class="term">constraint</span> is formalized with one or more <span class="term">execution languages</span>.
					This version of SHACL supports <a href="#sparql">SPARQL</a> as an <span class="term">execution language</span>, but other languages may be supported in future versions or by other communities.
					Each constraint needs to be backed by at least one <span class="term">executable body</span> in SPARQL, and any alternative bodies need to follow the same semantics as the SPARQL queries.
					Constraints may either directly define such an <span class="term">executable body</span> or point to a <a href="#templates"><span class="term">template</span></a>.
					Constraints that directly include an <span class="term">executable body</span> are called <span class="term">native constraints</span>.
					A <span class="term">template</span> serves as a parameterizable macro that wraps an <span class="term">executable body</span>.
					Constraints that rely on a <span class="term">template</span> are called <span class="term">template constraints</span>.
					The SHACL vocabulary includes a small library of such <span class="term">templates</span> for common constraint patterns, but anyone can add their own template libraries.
					Similar to constraint templates, SHACL also supports <span class="term">scope templates</span> that define a high-level vocabulary to represent <span class="term">scopes</span>.
					Templates can be grouped into so-called <a href="#profiles"><span class="term">profiles</span></a>.
					Some SHACL engines may decide to only support certain <span class="term">profiles</span> and implement them differently than the provided (SPARQL) bodies.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates the use of a <span class="term">native SPARQL constraint</span>,
					to specify that there cannot be two resources with the same <code>schema:email</code>.
					Note that each result set row produced by the SELECT clause of the SPARQL query creates one constraint violation.
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="A SPARQL-based constraint">
ex:UniqueEmailShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:constraint [
		sh:message "There cannot be two resources with the same email address." ;
		sh:predicate schema:email ;
		sh:sparql """
			SELECT ?this (?this AS ?subject) (?email AS ?object)
			WHERE {
				?this schema:email ?email .
				?other schema:email ?email .
				FILTER (?this != ?other) .
			}

			<h2>Shapes</h2>
			<div class="issue" data-number="23" title="Classes and/or Shapes">
				There is no agreement in the WG on the relationship of sh:Shape with RDFS classes.
				Proposals include:
				<ul>
					<li>Keep them completely separate, users only instantiate sh:Shape and use sh:extends</li>
					<li>Have rdfs:Class rdfs:subClassOf sh:Shape, use rdfs:subClassOf</li>
					<li>Have sh:Shape rdfs:subClassOf rdfs:Class, use rdfs:subClassOf</li>
					<li>Allow both approaches in parallel: either rdfs:Class/subClassOf or sh:Shape/extends</li>
					<li>Allow both and have sh:classShape or sh:classScope or sh:scopeClass to point from a class to its shapes (or vice versa)</li>
				</ul>
				In the absence of such an agreement, this document uses sh:Shape in most examples but allows
				classes to be also shapes, with the class sh:ShapeClass as syntactic sugar.
			</div>
			<p>
				A <span class="term">Constraint</span> defines restrictions on the structure of an RDF graph.
				A <span class="term">Shape</span> is a group of constraints that have the same focus nodes.
				For example, a shape can be used to state that all instances of a class must have a certain number of values for a given property.
				In that example, the instances of the class are the focus nodes, and the restriction on property values is expressed via a constraint.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the SHACL RDF vocabulary, Shapes are instances of the class <code>sh:Shape</code>.
			</p>
			<section id="shape-labels">
				<h3>Shape Labels and Comments</h3>
				<p>
					Like many other types of RDF resources, shapes SHOULD have human-readable labels via <code>rdfs:label</code>.
					The property <code>rdfs:comment</code> is recommended for documentation and definition purposes.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="shape-classes">
				<h3>Shapes and Classes</h3>
				<p>
					Shapes can be linked to RDFS classes via the property <code>sh:scopeClass</code>.
					The interpretation of this is that the <code>sh:Shape</code> is expected to apply to all instances of these linked classes,
					i.e. any resource that has the <code>sh:scopeClass</code> or one of its subclasses as its <code>rdf:type</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a <code>sh:Shape</code> is also an instance of <code>rdfs:Class</code> then the interpretation is that all instances of the class are expected to have the shape.
					There is a built-in subclass of <code>sh:Shape</code> called <code>sh:ShapeClass</code> that is also a subclass of <code>rdfs:Class</code> to simplify the declaration of shapes that are also classes.
				</p>
				<p>
					A consequence of these links between shapes and classes is that shape declarations can specialize the shapes associated with the superclasses, declared via <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following figure illustrates some relationships between core classes of SHACL and RDF Schema.
					Note that the use of a UML-like notation does not imply that these RDF concepts are classes in an object-oriented sense.

				<h3>Shape Constraints</h3>
				<p>
					A shape can be regarded as a collection of constraints on the same <span class="term">focus node</span>.
					These constraints can be grouped into three categories that are covered by subsequent sections.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="#property-constraints">Property Constraints</a> specify characteristics of a given property in the context of the Shape.
						The properties <code>sh:property</code> and <code>sh:inverseProperty</code> are used to link a Shape with its property constraints.
					</li>
					<li>
						The SHACL Core Profile includes <a href="#other">other shape-based constraints</a>:
						Logical operations including <a href="#not">not</a>, <a href="#and">and</a>, <a href="#or">or</a> and <a href="#xor">xor</a>,
						and	<a href="#ClosedShape">Closed Shapes</a> that cannot have any other property than those explicitly enumerated for a shape.
					</li>
					<li>
						For complex use cases that cannot be handled by the SHACL Core Profile,
						<a href="#general-constraints">General Constraints</a> may define constraints that are not related to only a single property.
						The property <code>sh:constraint</code> is used to link a Shape with its general constraints.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Orthogonal to these constraint types, SHACL has a notion of <a href="#filterShape">filter shapes</a> that can be used to define pre-conditions
					that must hold before a constraint is applied to a given <span class="term">focus node</span>.

		<section id="property-constraints">
			<h2>Property Constraints</h2>
			<p>
				In many cases, the constraints attached to a shape can be attributed to a given property of the focus nodes.
				Depending on the direction of triple traversal, SHACL defines two properties to associate a shape with such property-related constraints:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#property-constraints-property"><code>sh:property</code></a> is used to link a shape with property constraints (on the objects of triples)</li>
				<li><a href="#property-constraints-inverseProperty"><code>sh:inverseProperty</code></a> is used to link a shape with inverse property constraints (on the subjects of triples)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following sections describe the role of each of these properties in detail.
				Note that this section only includes textual definitions of the semantics of those properties.
				An alternative formal definition based on SPARQL is provided in an <a href="#sparql-template-defs">Appendix</a>.
			</p>

			<section id="property-constraints-property">
				<h3>Property Constraints (sh:property)</h3>
				<p>
					A <span class="term">property constraint</span> is a constraint that defines restrictions on the values of a given property in the context of the focus node.
					Here, the focus node is the <span class="term">subject</span> and the property is the <span class="term">predicate</span> of relevant triples.
					The property <code>sh:property</code> can be used to link a shape with its property constraints.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the SHACL RDF vocabulary, property constraints are instances of the class <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					When used as values of <code>sh:property</code>, property constraints represented as blank nodes do not require an <code>rdf:type</code> triple.
					Note that <code>sh:property</code> may also have values that are sub-classes of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>,
					but in this case the <code>rdf:type</code> triple is required.
					It is not valid to use <code>sh:property</code> for constraints that are not instance of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				</p>
				<p> 
					The following examples illustrate two ways of using property constraints.
					The first example uses a blank node:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Property constraint represented by a blank node">
ex:InlinePropertyConstraintExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:someProperty ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:valueClass ex:SomeClass ;
		rdfs:label "some property" ;
		rdfs:comment "Description of the role of ex:someProperty (in the context of the constraint)" ;
	] .</pre>
				<p>
					The second example defines a constraint as an IRI node, allowing it to be more easily referenced and shared across multiple shapes:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Property constraint represented by a IRI">
ex:StandAlonePropertyConstraintExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property ex:StandAloneConstraint .

ex:StandAloneConstraint
	a sh:PropertyConstraint ;
	sh:predicate ex:someProperty ;
	sh:defaultValue ex:SomeInstance ;
	sh:minCount 1 ;
	sh:valueClass ex:SomeClass .</pre>
				<p>
					Property constraints may have an <code>rdfs:label</code> to provide a human-readable label for the property	in the context where it appears.
					If present, tools SHOULD prefer those locally defined labels over globally defined labels at the <code>rdf:Property</code> itself.
					Similarly, property constraints may have an <code>rdfs:comment</code> to provide a description of the property in the given context.
					Both <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>rdfs:comment</code> may have multiple values, but SHOULD only have one value per language tag.
				</p>
				<p id="defaultValue">
					Property constraints may have a single value for <code>sh:defaultValue</code>.
					The default value does not have fixed semantics in SHACL, but may be used by user interface tools to pre-populate input widgets.
					The value type of the <code>sh:defaultValue</code> SHOULD align with the specified <code>sh:datatype</code> or <code>sh:valueClass</code> of the same constraint.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following sections provide details on the properties that may be used with <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					Note that the textual definitions of those properties refers to the <a href="#violations">Constraint Violations Vocabulary</a>
					introduced in a later section.

					The RDF data model offers a huge amount of flexibility.

					The SHACL core language includes a construct called <code>sh:ClosedShape</code> that can be assigned to

						RDF Schema and OWL provide a well-established framework to model domains in terms of classes and instances.

						The property <code>sh:scopeClass</code> can be used to link a <code>sh:Shape</code> with an <code>rdfs:Class</code>.
						The property <code>rdf:type</code> is used to determine which shapes a given node are expected to fulfill.
						The scope includes all instances of the <code>sh:scopeClass</code> and its subclasses, by following <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> triples.

					In order to support such use cases, SHACL includes the concept of <span class="term">filter shapes</span> that act as pre-conditions that all focus nodes need to fulfill before they are being validated.
					Formally, filter shapes eliminate entries from the collection of focus nodes selected by a shape's scopes, if the focus node produces an error-level constraint violation for the given filter shapes.

					<p>
						Constraint violations may have a single value for the property <code>sh:root</code> to point to an

						each of which can have at most one value.
						<code>sh:predicate</code> can only be present if either <code>sh:subject</code> or <code>sh:object</code> have also been specified.

			<h2>General Shape Constraints (sh:constraint)</h2>
			<p>
				Note that the subsequent sections cover features of SHACL that go beyond the <span class="term">SHACL Core Profile</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The property <code>sh:constraint</code> provides the most general mechanism to associate a constraint with a shape.
				The values of this property must be <span class="term">constraints</span>, i.e. they MAY reference a <span class="term">focus node</span>.
				Note that the property <code>sh:property</code> SHOULD be used instead of <code>sh:constraint</code> if the constraint is a <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				The property <code>sh:inverseProperty</code> SHOULD be used instead of <code>sh:constraint</code> if the constraint is a <code>sh:InversePropertyConstraint</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				SHACL supports two types of general shape constraints:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>General shape constraints based on a high-level vocabulary (template)</li>
				<li>General shape constraints based on a native executable (such as a SPARQL query)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following example assumes that there is a high-level template called <code>myt:DisjointPropertiesConstraint</code> that takes two arguments
				<code>myt:property1</code> and <code>myt:property2</code>.
				The intent of that example is to state that the values of the properties <code>ex:father</code> and <code>ex:mother</code> must be disjoint.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following example illustrates the definition of a <span class="term">constraint</span> based on a SPARQL query.
				The property <code>sh:sparql</code> is used to point at a SELECT query as explained in a later <a href="#sparql-constraints">section</a>.
				Note that the variable <code>?this</code> is used to reference the <span class="term">focus node</span>.

				Constraint templates can be instantiated anywhere where a native constraint may appear (for example, at <code>sh:constraint</code>).
				Scope templates can be instantiated anywhere where a native scope may appear, at <code>sh:scope</code>.
				SHACL includes several templates that were deemed to be of general use, including the <a href="#shapeconstraints-property">property constraint templates</a>.
				Such templates form a high-level vocabulary that may be directly interpreted ("hard-coded") without reliance on their executable bodies.

				</p>

					The local names of the values of <code>sh:predicate</code> must match the following conditions (to ensure a correct mapping from arguments into SPARQL variables is possible):
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="term">local name</span> must be a valid <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#rVARNAME">SPARQL VARNAME</a></li>
					<li>There must not be any other declared <code>sh:Argument</code> for the same template (and its transitive superclasses) that has a <code>sh:predicate</code> with the same <span class="term">local name</span></li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may have its property <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code>
					to indicate that the argument is not mandatory.
				</p>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare a default value via <code>sh:defaultValue</code>.
					For non-optional arguments, the engine must use the declared default value for template instances that do not define a value for this argument.
				</p>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare one value for the property <code>sh:valueClass</code> or one value for
					<code>sh:datatype</code>, similar to their counterparts in property constraints.
					This can be used to communicate the expected value type of the argument in template instances.
					Some implementations MAY use this information to prevent the execution of a template with invalid arguments, and to signal errors.

			<p>
				The class <code>sh:Profile</code> is used to represent SHACL profiles.
				The properties <code>sh:constraintTemplate</code> and <code>sh:scopeTemplate</code> link a <code>sh:Profile</code> with the templates that are in the profile.
				The following example defines a profile consisting of the two SHACL templates for min/max cardinality and value shape,

			<h2>Functions</h2>
			<p>
				SHACL <span class="term">functions</span> define operations that produce an RDF node based on arguments.
				Functions can be called within SPARQL queries to encapsulate complex logic of other SPARQL queries, or executable logic in other languages such as JavaScript.
				However, the general declaration mechanism for SHACL functions is independent from SPARQL and may also be exploited by other environments.
			</p>
			<p>
				Functions must be declared as instances of the class <code>sh:Function</code>.
				Well-defined, non-abstract functions MUST provide at least one executable body property such as <a href="#sparql-functions"><code>sh:sparql</code></a> so that one of the registered <span class="term">execution languages</span> return <code>true</code> for <code>canExecutionFunction()</code>.
				The following example illustrates the definition of a <span class="term">function</span> based on a SPARQL query.
			</p>

		WHERE {
		}
		""" .</pre>
			<p>
				The following sections introduce details of the properties that such functions may have.
			</p>
			<section id="function-arguments">
				<h3>Function Arguments</h3>
				<p>
					The arguments of a function are attached to its <code>sh:Function</code> via the property <code>sh:argument</code>.
					Each argument must be an instance of <code>sh:Argument</code>.
					The <code>rdf:type</code> triple of the argument can be omitted if it is a blank node with an incoming <code>sh:argument</code> triple.
					Arguments are ordered, corresponding to the notation of function calls in SPARQL such as
					<code>ex:exampleFunction(?arg1, ?arg2)</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> MUST have exactly one value for the property <code>sh:predicate</code>.
					The values of <code>sh:predicate</code> must be <code>sh:arg1</code> for the first argument,
					<code>sh:arg2</code> for the second argument, etc.
					Arguments are "inherited" from the superclasses of the function.
					For example if a superclass already declares <code>sh:arg1</code> then subclasses may only define <code>sh:arg2</code> etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> may have its property <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code>
					to indicate that the argument is not mandatory.
					If an argument has been declared optional, then all succeeding arguments must also be declared optional.
				</p>
				<p>
					Similar to <a href="#property-constraints">Property Constraints</a>, each <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare one value for the property <code>sh:datatype</code> or one value for the property <code>sh:valueClass</code>.
					This can be used to communicate the expected value type of the argument in function calls.
					Some implementations MAY use this information to prevent the execution of a function with invalid arguments, and to signal errors.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="function-returnType">
				<h3>sh:returnType</h3>
				<p>
					A function may declare a single return type via <code>sh:returnType</code>.
					This information may serve for documentation purposes, only.
					However, in some execution languages such as JavaScript, the declared <code>sh:returnType</code> may inform
					the engine how to cast a native value into an RDF value type.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="function-cachable">
				<h3>sh:cachable</h3>
				<p>
					A <code>sh:Function</code> may have a property <code>sh:cachable</code> set to <code>true</code>.
					Functions that are marked as cachable MUST always return the same value for the same combination of arguments, regardless of the query graphs.
					Engines can use this information to cache and reuse previous function calls without repeatedly evaluating their executable body.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>

		<section id="entailment">
			<h3>Entailment</h3>
			<p>
				By default, SHACL does not assume any <span class="term">entailment regime</span> [[sparql11-entailment]] to be actviated on the graph that is queried.
				However, the property <code>sh:entailment</code> can be used to instruct a SHACL engine to ensure that a given entailment is activated.
				The values of <code>sh:entailment</code> must be IRIs, with common use cases covered by [[sparql11-entailment]].
				The subject of <code>sh:entailment</code> must be the IRI of the shapes graph itself.
			</p>
			<p>
				If the engine is not capable of supporting the given entailment regime, then it MUST produce a <code>sh:FatalError</code>.
				Standard-compliant SHACL implementations are not required to support any entailment regimes.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="sparql">
			<h2>SPARQL-based Execution (sh:sparql)</h2>
			<p>
				The property <code>sh:sparql</code> is used to link constraints, templates and functions with an executable body in SPARQL.
				The values of <code>sh:sparql</code> must be string literals that can be parsed into syntactically valid SPARQL queries.
				Prior to parsing, a SHACL engine MUST add all prefix declarations from the defining graph into the beginning of the string.
				This means that the values of <code>sh:sparql</code> do not have to explicitly state any <code>@prefix</code> declarations for the prefixes used in the SPARQL query.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following sections provide details on how <code>sh:sparql</code> is interpreted for

				<h3>SPARQL-based Scopes</h3>
				<p>
					The SPARQL queries attached to a <span class="term">scope</span> via <code>sh:sparql</code> MUST be of the query form <code>SELECT</code>, or a fragment that produces a valid <code>SELECT</code> query if wrapped by <code>SELECT ?this WHERE { ... }</code>.
					The SELECT queries MUST project to the result variable <code>?this</code>.
					The results of execution consists of all distinct bindings for the variable <code>?this</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The SELECT queries MUST also be executable when converted to an ASK query and with a pre-bound value for <code>?this</code>.
					The set of bindings for <code>?this</code> that return <code>true</code> for such ASK queries must be identical to the set produced by the SELECT query.
					This constraint makes sure that engines can evaluate whether a given shape applies to a given focus node as part of the <a href="#operation-validateNode">validateNode</a> operation.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following example illustrates a well-formed SPARQL-based scope that produces all persons born in the USA:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="SPARQL-based scope example">
ex:USCitizenShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:scope [
		sh:sparql """
			SELECT ?this
			WHERE {
				?this a ex:Person .
				?this ex:bornIn ex:USA .
			}
			""" ;
	] ;
	sh:constraint ...</pre>

				<h3>SPARQL-based Templates</h3>
				<p>
					If a <code>sh:Template</code> has a value for <code>sh:sparql</code>, then the corresponding instances need to follow the same execution rules as outlined for <a href="#sparql-constraints">SPARQL-based Constraints</a> and <a href="#sparql-constraints">SPARQL-based Scopes</a>.
					The only difference is that the SPARQL queries need to be executed with additional <span class="term">pre-bound</span> variables, derived from the arguments of the template.
					The names of those variables must match the <a href="#def-local-name"><span class="term">local name</span></a> of the argument predicates, including the arguments defined by any (transitive) superclasses of the template.
					For example, if an argument is represented with the predicate <code>ex:myArgument</code> then the variable <code>?myArgument</code> must be <span class="term">pre-bound</span> with the value of the argument in the template instance.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="sparql-functions">
				<h3>SPARQL-based Functions</h3>
				<p>
					If a <code>sh:Function</code> has a value for <code>sh:sparql</code>, then a SPARQL-based execution engine SHOULD
					execute the provided SPARQL query on the current data set.
					In this SPARQL query, the engine needs to <span class="term">pre-bind</span> the variables <code>?arg1</code>, <code>?arg2</code> etc
					based on the provided arguments of the function call.
					The SPARQL query must be of type ASK or SELECT.
					For ASK queries, the function's return value is the result of the ASK query execution.
					For SELECT queries, the function's return value is the first binding of the first result variable in the result set.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some execution engines may ignore the specified <code>sh:sparql</code> query and rely on an alternative (possibly native) implementation instead,
					as long as the functions return the same values as the specified <code>sh:sparql</code> query.
					This can be used to optimize frequently needed functions.
					Some processors may even use the <code>sh:sparql</code> query to rewrite other SPARQL queries via inlining techniques.
