				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is an RDF vocabulary for describing RDF graph structures.
				Some of these graph structures are captured as "shapes", which are expected to correspond to nodes in RDF graphs.
				Shapes provide a high-level vocabulary to identify predicates and their associated cardinalities, datatypes and other constraints.
				Additional constraints can either be stated globally or be associated with shapes, using SPARQL and similar executable languages.
				These executable languages can also be used to define new high-level vocabulary terms.
				SHACL shapes can be used to communicate data structures associated with some process or interface, generate or validate data, or drive user interfaces.
				This document defines the SHACL RDF vocabulary together with its underlying semantics.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is an RDF vocabulary to formulate structural constraints on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-graph">RDF graphs</a>.
				The SHACL vocabulary includes high-level concepts to represent restrictions on predicates used in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-triple">triples</a>.
				These restrictions can be grouped into "<span class="term">shapes</span>".
				Shapes can be used to restrict the number of property values and the permitted value types as well as other conditions.
				Some users and implementors will be content with using the high-level shapes language only, which is called the <span class="term">SHACL Core Profile</span>
				and is described in sections 2 to 6 of this document.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more complex use cases, SHACL also includes facilities to define almost arbitrary restrictions, expressed in SPARQL and, possibly, other languages such as JavaScript.
				SHACL includes macro facilities for the creation of new high-level vocabulary terms based on languages like SPARQL.
				These advanced topics are covered from section 7 onwards.

				<h3>Overview and Terminology</h3>
				<p>
					The basic building blocks of SHACL are <span class="term">constraints</span>.
					Each <span class="term">constraint</span> defines an atomic condition that can be checked against a graph.
					The output of constraint checking is a set of <span class="term">constraint violations</span>.
					The checking of each <span class="term">constraint</span> is formalized with one or more <span class="term">execution languages</span>.
					SPARQL is the only built-in <span class="term">execution language</span> in SHACL, but other languages may be supported in future versions or by other communities.
					Each constraint needs to be backed by at least one <span class="term">executable body</span> in SPARQL, and any alternative bodies need to follow the same semantics as the SPARQL queries.
					Constraints may either directly define such an <span class="term">executable body</span> or point at a <span class="term">template</span>.
					Constraints that directly include an <span class="term">executable body</span> (via <code>sp:sparql</code>) are called <span class="term">native constraints</span>.
					A <span class="term">template</span> serves as a parameterizable macro that wraps an <span class="term">executable body</span>.
					Constraints that rely on a <span class="term">template</span> are called <span class="term">template constraints</span>.
					SHACL includes a small library of such <span class="term">templates</span> for common constraint patterns, but anyone can add their own template libraries.
					Templates can be grouped into <span class="term">profiles</span>.
					Some SHACL engines may decide to only support certain <span class="term">profiles</span> and implement them differently than the provided (SPARQL) bodies.
				</p>
				<p>
					Constraints are either <span class="term">global</span> or <span class="term">local</span>.
					<span class="term">Global constraints</span> are executed when constraint checking is invoked on the whole graph, and may verify arbitrary conditions.
					<span class="term">Local constraints</span> are evaluated against a given <span class="term">focus node</span> (represented by the variable <code>?this</code> in SPARQL).
					The <span class="term">focus node</span> serves as starting point of property paths and other graph traversal algorithms.
					A <span class="term">shape</span> describes a group of <span class="term">local constraints</span> with the same <span class="term">focus node</span>.
					Shapes may be arranged in a <span class="term">specialization</span> hierarchy, allowing some shapes to further narrow down the constraints from other shapes.
					Current proposals for such specialization mechanisms include <code>sh:extends</code> and <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> triples.
					The latter implies that the nodes of RDFS classes may also be interpreted as shapes.
				</p>
				<p>
					One of the <span class="term">operations</span> that SHACL engines should support verifies that a given RDF node matches a given shape.
					This operation can be invoked based on any control logic, i.e. applications can pick their own mapping between RDF nodes and their shapes.
					SHACL also provides two mapping mechanisms based on the RDF triples in the graph being checked.
					Current proposals for these mechanisms include selection based on <code>sh:nodeShape</code> and <code>rdf:type</code> triples.
					Based on such in-graph mappings, SHACL supports constraint checking over a complete graph.
				</p>
				<p>
					SHACL definitions are represented in RDF and can be serialized in multiple RDF formats.
					The example snippets in this document use Turtle [[turtle]] and <span class="todo">(not written yet:)</span> JSON-LD [[json-ld]] notation.
					The reader should be familiar with basic RDF concepts [[rdf11-concepts]] such as triples and (for the advanced concepts of SHACL) with SPARQL [[sparql11-overview]].

			<h2>Constraint Violations Vocabulary</h2>
			<p>
				The output of a SHACL constraint checking operation is a set of <span class="term">constraint violations</span>.
				SHACL includes an RDF vocabulary to represent such constraint violations together with
				structural information that may provide guidance on how to fix the violation, as well as
				human-readable messages.
			</p>
			<p>
				The following code snippet represents a valid constraint violation that may have been produced
				by a constraint checking engine:
			</p>
			<pre class="example" title="A constructed constraint violation">
ex:ExampleConstraintViolation
	a sh:Error ;
	sh:root ex:MyCurrentNode ;
	sh:path ex:someProperty ;
	sh:value ex:someInvalidValue ;
	sh:message "Incorrect value: expected something else here." .</pre>
			<section id="violations-types">
				<h3>Types of Constraints Violations</h3>
				<p>
					A constraint violation is represented by a IRI or blank node that has exactly one
					asserted <code>rdf:type</code>.
					The <code>rdf:type</code> arc of a constraint violation must point to one of the subclasses
					of the ("abstract") base class <code>sh:ConstraintViolation</code>.
					The SHACL system vocabulary includes the following constraint violation types: 
				</p>
				<table class="term-table" border="1" cellpadding="5">
					<tr>
						<th>Constraint&nbsp;Violation&nbsp;Class</th>
						<th>Superclass</th>
						<th>Description</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><code>sh:Warning</code></td>
						<td><code>sh:ConstraintViolation</code></td>
						<td>A non-critical constraint violation indicating a warning.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><code>sh:Error</code></td>
						<td><code>sh:ConstraintViolation</code></td>
						<td>A constraint violation indicating an error.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><code>sh:FatalError</code></td>
						<td><code>sh:Error</code></td>
						<td>
							An error that cannot be recovered and further evaluation may terminate immediately.
							Engines may decide to perform fatal checks first.
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p class="todo">
					<code>sh:Info</code> has also been suggested, but this would work best if there was a deterministic mechanism to identify
					constraints that need to be checked, so that Info constraints can be bypassed.
					Related to this, Dimitris also suggested we introduce <code>sh:ValidationResult</code> as a superclass of <code>sh:ConstraintViolation</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					SHACL extensions may define additional violation types, as long as they are rooted in
					<code>sh:ConstraintViolation</code>.
					The <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code> relationship between these types indicates specialization,
					e.g. <code>sh:FatalError</code> is a subclass of <code>sh:Error</code> meaning that every
					fatal error should also be regarded as an error.
				</p>
				<p class="todo">
					TODO: There is an ongoing <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-data-shapes-wg/2015Mar/0011.html">proposal</a> to use these violation levels at engine control time.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="violations-structure">
				<h3>Structural Violation Metadata</h3>
				<p>
					SHACL constraint violations may include machine-readable metadata that points at
					the cause of the violation.
				</p>
				<section id="violations-structure-root">
					<h4>sh:root</h4>
					<p>
						Constraint violations may have a single value for the property <code>sh:root</code> to point to an
						IRI or blank node that has caused the violation.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="violations-structure-path">
					<h4>sh:path</h4>
					<p>
						Constraint violations may have one or more values for the property <code>sh:path</code>
						that describes a <em>path expression</em> that can be walked starting at the <code>sh:root</code>.
						If the value of this property is a IRI, then the path produces all triples that have the root node as
						subject and the value as its predicate.
						If the value of <code>sh:path</code> is a blank node, then it must have properties that
						match either one of the following options: 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<code>sh:inverse</code> describes an inverse path consisting of all paths that start
							at the current root node and walk the given predicate backwards, i.e. from object to subject.
							The values of <code>sh:inverse</code> must be the IRIs of properties.
							Blank nodes with <code>sh:inverse</code> may have the optional type <code>sh:InversePath</code>.
						</li>
						<li>
							<code>sh:path1</code> and <code>sh:path2</code> describe a sequence path consisting of
							two other paths.  The values of these properties must be property IRIs or blank nodes
							of the same recursive path structure.  The path produces the concatenation of the two sub-paths.
							Blank nodes with <code>sh:path1</code> and <code>sh:path2</code> may have the optional type <code>sh:SequencePath</code>.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The following example describes a path equivalent to the SPARQL 1.1 Property Path [[sparql11-query]]
						<code>ex:firstProperty/((^ex:inverseProperty)/ex:lastProperty)</code>
					</p>
					<pre class="example" title="Constraint violation with path expression">
ex:ExampleConstraintViolationWithPath
	a sh:Error ;
	sh:root ex:MyCurrentNode ;
	sh:path [
		sh:path1 ex:firstProperty ;
		sh:path2 [
			ex:path1 [ sh:inverse ex:inverseProperty ] ;
			ex:path2 ex:lastProperty
		]
	] .</pre>
					<p class="todo">
						Open discussion: Dimitris suggested that we may want to allow path expressions as xsd:strings too,
						and rdf:Lists for sequence paths.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="violations-structure-value">
					<h4>sh:value</h4>
					<p>
						Constraint violations may have one or more values of the property <code>sh:value</code> to
						point at specific nodes that caused the violation.
						These nodes SHOULD be accessible via at least one <code>sh:path</code> starting at the
						specific <code>sh:root</code> node.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="violations-structure-source">
					<h4>sh:source</h4>
					<p>
						Constraint violations may point at one <code>sh:Constraint</code> that has caused
						the violation, specified via the property <code>sh:source</code>.
						SHACL constraint checking engines SHOULD automatically insert the <code>sh:source</code>
						based on the currently evaluated constraint, unless the constraint violation already has
						such a value.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="violations-structure-detail">
					<h4>sh:detail</h4>
					<p>
						The property <code>sh:detail</code> may link a (parent) constraint violation with one or more other
						(child) constraint violations that provide further details about the cause of the (parent) violation.
						Depending on the capabilities of the constraint checking engine, this may include failures of
						nested constraints that have been evaluated via <code>sh:valueShape</code>.
					</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			<section id="violations-message">
				<h3>Human-readable Violation Messages (sh:message)</h3>
				<p>
					Constraint violations may have values for the property <code>sh:message</code> to communicate
					additional textual details to humans.
					While <code>sh:message</code> may have multiple values, there SHOULD not be two values
					with the same language tag.

			<h2>Shapes</h2>
			<div class="issue" title="Classes and/or Shapes">
				There is no agreement in the WG on the relationship of sh:Shape with RDFS classes.

					<li>Allow both approaches in parallel: either rdfs:Class/subClassOf or sh:Shape/extends</li>
					<li>Allow both and have sh:classShape to point from a class to its shape(s)</li>

				In the absence of such an agreement, this document uses sh:Shape in all examples.

				A <span class="term">Constraint</span> defines restrictions on the structure of an RDF graph.

				A <span class="term">Shape</span> is a group of constraints that have the same focus nodes.
				For example, a shape can be used to state that all instances of a class must have a certain number of values for a given property.
				In that example, the instances of the class are the focus nodes, and the restriction on property values is expressed via a constraint.

			<section id="shape-labels">
				<h3>Shape Labels and Comments</h3>

				</p>
				<p class="todo">

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="#property-constraints">Property Constraints</a> specify characteristics of a given property in the context of the Shape.

			</section>
		</section>
		
		<section id="property-constraints">
			<h2>Property Constraints</h2>
			<p>
				In many cases, the constraints attached to a shape can be attributed to a given property of the focus nodes.
				Depending on the direction of triple traversal, SHACL defines two properties to associate a shape with such property-related constraints:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="#property-constraints-property"><code>sh:property</code></a> is used to link a shape with property constraints (on the objects of triples)</li>
				<li><a href="#property-constraints-inverseProperty"><code>sh:inverseProperty</code></a> is used to link a shape with inverse property constraints (on the subjects of triples)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following sections describe the role of each of these properties in detail.
				Note that this section only includes textual definitions of the semantics of those properties.
				An alternative formal definition based on SPARQL is provided in an <a href="#sparql-template-defs">Appendix</a>.
				<span class="todo">Additional formal definitions of these built-ins may be published in separate deliverables.</span> 
			</p>

			<section id="property-constraints-property">
				<h3>Property Constraints (sh:property)</h3>
				<p>
					A <span class="term">property constraint</span> is a constraint that defines restrictions on the values of a given property in the context of the focus node.
					Here, the focus node is the <span class="term">subject</span> and the property is the <span class="term">predicate</span> of relevant triples.
					The property <code>sh:property</code> can be used to link a shape with its property constraints.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the SHACL RDF vocabulary, property constraints are instances of the class <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					When used as values of <code>sh:property</code>, property constraints represented as blank nodes do not require an <code>rdf:type</code> triple.
					Note that <code>sh:property</code> may also have values that are sub-classes of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>,
					but in this case the <code>rdf:type</code> triple is required.
					It is not valid to use <code>sh:property</code> for constraints that are not instance of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Technically, <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code> is also a <span class="term">Template</span> (introduced in a later <a href="#templates">section</a>).
					However, for the purpose of this section, it suffices to understand that each property constraint can have one or more
					<span class="term">facet properties</span> such as <code>sh:minCount</code> that have a pre-defined meaning to a SHACL processor.
				</p>
				<p> 
					The following examples illustrate two ways of using property constraints.
					The first example uses a blank node:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Property constraint represented by a blank node">
ex:InlinePropertyConstraintExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property [
		sh:predicate ex:someProperty ;
		sh:minCount 1 ;
		sh:valueType ex:SomeClass ;
		rdfs:label "some property" ;
		rdfs:comment "Description of the role of ex:someProperty (in the context of the constraint)" ;
	] .</pre>
				<p>
					The second example defines a constraint as an IRI node, allowing it to be more easily referenced and shared across multiple shapes:
				</p>
				<pre class="example" title="Property constraint represented by a IRI">
ex:StandAlonePropertyConstraintExampleShape
	a sh:Shape ;
	sh:property ex:StandAloneConstraint .

ex:StandAloneConstraint
	a sh:PropertyConstraint ;
	sh:predicate ex:someProperty ;
	sh:defaultValue ex:SomeInstance ;
	sh:minCount 1 ;
	sh:valueType ex:SomeClass .</pre>
				<p>
					Property constraints may have an <code>rdfs:label</code> to provide a human-readable label for the property	in the context where it appears.
					If present, tools SHOULD prefer those locally defined labels over globally defined labels at the <code>rdf:Property</code> itself.
					Similarly, property constraints may have an <code>rdfs:comment</code> to provide a description of the property in the given context.
					Both <code>rdfs:label</code> and <code>rdfs:comment</code> may have multiple values, but SHOULD only have one value per language tag.
				</p>
				<p id="defaultValue">
					Property constraints may have a single value for <code>sh:defaultValue</code>.
					The default value does not have fixed semantics in SHACL, but may be used by user interface tools to pre-populate input widgets.
					The value type of the <code>sh:defaultValue</code> SHOULD align with the specified <code>sh:valueType</code> of the same constraint.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following sections provide details on the built-in facet properties that may be used with <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
					The facet properties are defined by templates that serve as abstract superclasses of <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.

			<h2>General Shape Constraints (sh:constraint)</h2>
			<p>
				Note that the subsequent sections cover features of SHACL that go beyond the <span class="term">SHACL Core Profile</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The property <code>sh:constraint</code> provides the most general mechanism to associate a constraint with a shape.
				The values of this property must be <span class="term">local constraints</span>, i.e. they MUST reference a
				<span class="term">focus node</span>.
				Note that the property <code>sh:property</code> SHOULD be used instead of <code>sh:constraint</code> if the constraint is a <code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code>.
				The property <code>sh:inverseProperty</code> SHOULD be used instead of <code>sh:constraint</code> if the constraint is a <code>sh:InversePropertyConstraint</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				SHACL supports two types of general shape constraints:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>General shape constraints based on a high-level vocabulary (template)</li>
				<li>General shape constraints based on a native executable (such as a SPARQL query)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The following example assumes that there is a high-level template called <code>myt:DisjointPropertiesConstraint</code> that takes two arguments
				<code>myt:property1</code> and <code>myt:property2</code>.
				The intent of that example is to state that the values of the properties <code>ex:father</code> and <code>ex:mother</code> must be disjoint.
			</p>
			<pre class="example">
@prefix myt: &lt;http://example.org/myTemplates#&gt; .

		a myt:DisjointPropertiesConstraint ;
		myt:property1 ex:father ;
		myt:property2 ex:mother ;
	] .</pre>
			<p>
				The following example illustrates the definition of a <span class="term">local constraint</span> based on a SPARQL query.
				The property <code>sh:sparql</code> is used to point at a SELECT query as explained in a later <a href="#sparql-constraints">section</a>.
				Note that the variable <code>?this</code> is used to reference the <span class="term">focus node</span>.
			</p>
			<pre class="example">

			<h2>Templates</h2>
			<p>
				Templates can be used to encapsulate and parameterize <span class="term">executable bodies</span> based on arguments.
				Templates can be instantiated anywhere where a native constraint may appear (for example, at <code>sh:constraint</code>).
				SHACL includes several templates that were deemed to be of general use, including the <a href="#shapeconstraints-property">property constraint templates</a>.
				Such templates form a high-level vocabulary that may be directly interpreted ("hard-coded") without reliance on their executable bodies.
			</p>
			<p>
				Constraint templates are represented as IRI nodes that are instances of the class <code>sh:ConstraintTemplate</code>.
				SHACL also includes a more general superclass <code>sh:Template</code> that may be used for other kinds of templates (rules, stored queries etc).
				Well-defined, non-abstract templates MUST provide at least one executable body property using <a href="#sparql-templates"><code>sh:sparql</code></a>.
				The following example illustrates the definition of a local constraint template based on a SPARQL query.

			<section id="template-arguments">
				<h3>Template Arguments</h3>
				<p>
					The arguments of a template are attached via the property <code>sh:argument</code>.
					Each argument must be an instance of <code>sh:Argument</code>.
					The <code>rdf:type</code> triple of the argument can be omitted if it is a blank node with an incoming <code>sh:argument</code> triple.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> MUST have exactly one value for the property <code>sh:predicate</code>.
					The values of <code>sh:predicate</code> must be IRIs such that no pair of argument predicates in the scope of the same template have the same local name.
					(This ensures that there is a unique mapping from arguments into SPARQL variables). <span class="todo">TODO: Check if all local names can become variables, otherwise define translation algorithm.</span>
					Arguments are "inherited" from the superclasses of the template <span class="todo">(may need details)</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may have its property <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code>
					to indicate that the argument is not mandatory.
				</p>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare a default value via <code>sh:defaultValue</code>.
					For non-optional arguments, the engine must use the declared default value for template instances that do not define a value for this argument.
				</p>
				<p>
					An <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare one value for the property <code>sh:valueType</code>.
					This can be used to communicate the expected value type of the argument in template instances.
					Some implementations MAY use this information to prevent the execution of a template with invalid arguments, and to signal errors.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="template-labelTemplate">
				<h3>sh:labelTemplate</h3>
				<p>
					The property <code>sh:labelTemplate</code> can be used to suggest how instances of the template shall be rendered to humans.

					where <code>?varName</code> is the name of the SPARQL variable that corresponds to the argument.
					In SPARQL-based systems, the function <a href="#function-label"><code>sh:label</code></a> may be used to expand those label templates into consumable strings.

		<section id="profiles">
			<h2>Profiles</h2>
			<p>
				A Profile is a set of shape templates.
				Profiles can be used to define controlled sub-dialects of SHACL, e.g. with desirable complexity.
				Tools may decide to only support certain profiles, for example so that they can hard-code and optimize certain algorithms.
				Since Profiles are entirely based on templates, <span class="term">native constraints</span> such as those in SPARQL are outside of their expressivity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The class <code>sh:Profile</code> is used to represent SHACL profiles.
				The property <code>sh:member</code> links a <code>sh:Profile</code> with the templates that are in the profile.
				The following example defines a profile consisting of the two built-in templates for min/max cardinality and value shape,
				as well as their shared superclass (which defines the <code>sh:predicate</code> property) and their shared subclass
				<code>sh:PropertyConstraint</code> that is directly instantiated.
			</p>

				<h3>Shape Selection</h3>
				<p>
					Some operations on SHACL graphs, such as <a href="#operation-checkNode"><code>checkNode</code></a> and
					<a href="#operation-checkGraph"><code>checkGraph</code></a> rely on in-graph information to determine
					which nodes need to be evaluated against which shapes.
					This section describes the two currently supported <span class="term">shape selection</span> properties.
				</p>
				<div class="issue" title="Shape selection">
					There are multiple proposals on how to associate resources with their shapes, in particular
					based on rdf:type or sh:nodeShape.
					The WG may chose to:
					<ul>
						<li>Only support one of these patterns</li>
						<li>Always support both of these patterns</li>
						<li>Support both of these patterns, allowing them to be switched on or off individually</li>

					<h4>Shape Selection based on rdf:type</h4>
					<p>
						RDF Schema and OWL provide a well-established framework to model domains in terms of classes and instances.
						A lot of existing data is already represented using these languages.
						In this <span class="term">shape selector</span>, the IRIs of classes double as shape definitions, i.e.
						it is possible to directly attach constraints at the IRI of a class.
						The property <code>rdf:type</code> is used to determine which shapes a given node needs to fulfill.
						Specialization between shapes is expressed via <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>.
						This pattern is illustrated in the following example.
					</p>
					<pre class="example" title="Shape selection based on rdf:type">
ex:ExampleClass
	a rdfs:Class ;
	sh:constraint [
		...
	] .

ex:ExampleInstance

				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Shape Selection based on sh:nodeShape</h4>
					<p>
						In some application scenarios, there may be unwanted interactions between existing RDFS models and shapes.
						For example, an application may want to ensure that there is no interaction between shapes and RDFS/OWL inferencing.
						In those cases, users can declare shapes as instances of <code>sh:Shape</code> and use <code>sh:nodeShape</code>
						to point from a node to its shape(s).
						This pattern is illustrated in the following example.

					Arguments are "inherited" from the superclasses of the function.
					For example if a superclass already declares <code>sh:arg1</code> then subclasses may only define <code>sh:arg2</code> etc.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> may have its property <code>sh:optional</code> set to <code>true</code>
					to indicate that the argument is not mandatory.
					If an argument has been declared optional, then all succeeding arguments must also be declared optional.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each <code>sh:Argument</code> may declare one value for the property <code>sh:valueType</code>.

			<h2>SPARQL Definitions of the Built-in Templates</h2>

				The following subsections define the semantics of the high-level constraint vocabulary built into SHACL using SPARQL.

				Pre-bound variables such are printed such as <code class="arg">?this</code>.
				SPARQL-based implementations of SHACL may use variations of the provided SPARQL queries, as long as they expose compatible behavior.

						Some WG members have voiced concerns that the definition above requires a built-in sh:hasShape that may

						An alternative design would be to hard-code the <code>sh:valueShape</code> property into the engine,
						and do the recursion in the outer layer, outside of SPARQL.
